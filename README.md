# wiz - Wake and induction zone

Wake and induction zone models for wind farm calculations. 

Please note that this repository is still under active development. 

Four main induction models are implemented:
  - "VC": vortex cylinder (VC) model 
  - "VCFF": vortex cylinder model with a far-field (FF) approximation to speed up calculations
  - "VD": vortex dipole model
  - "SS": self-similar model of Troldborg et al.


## QuickStart
Cloning, getting dependencies, installing local package and running tests:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ebranlard/wiz
cd wiz
python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt     # install requirements
python -m pip install -e .                           # install as local package
make                                                 # run tests 
```
If the unittests do not run, check the installation process and post an issue. 

If you wish to use FLORIS, continue with the following commands:
```bash
git submodule update --init
cd floris
python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt     # install requirements
python -m pip install -e .                           # install as local package
```

## Standalone examples for induction-zone / vorticity models
Found in the following folders:
  - `wiz\examples`: the high level scripts `WindTurbine.py` and `WindFarm.py` provide examples to compute the velocity field about a wind turbine or wind farm. Other scripts in this repository use lower level examples
  - `wiz\article_*`: the scripts in this folder reproduce some plots presented in publications by the authors. They can be run as standalone and are also part of the unittests.
  - `wiz\*.py`: unittests are present in most files.

## Examples with FLORIS coupling
Found in the folder `coupling_examples`
